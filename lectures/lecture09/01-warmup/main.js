/**
 * Challenges:
 * 1. As you click / drag, can the circles have different colors and sizes?
 *      * Try using the Math.random() function
 * 2. Can you make the click / drag sometimes make circles and sometimes make rectangles
 *      * Sample rectangle function invocation: rect(mouseX, mouseY, 100, 100);
 * 3. Can you make each click create a bulleye of different colors?
 *      * Hint: make sure you draw the bigger circles before you draw the smaller circles.
